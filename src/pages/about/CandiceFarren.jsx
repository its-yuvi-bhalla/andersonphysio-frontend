        {/* Biography */}
        <p>
          Candice is a dedicated physiotherapist with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Physiotherapy. She aims to deliver
          high-quality care with her extensive experience in orthopedics, womenâ€™s pelvic health, neuromuscular
          rehabilitation, temporomandibular joint (TMJ) rehabilitation, concussion rehabilitation, and
          cardio-respiratory care.
        </p>
        <p>
          She completed her Bachelorâ€™s in Physiotherapy in 2003, after which she worked at Breach Candy Hospital,
          Mumbai, gaining experience in orthopedics, neuromuscular care, cardio-respiratory therapy, and the surgical ICU.
        </p>
        <p>
          From 2004 to 2016, Candice practiced physiotherapy in the Kingdom of Bahrain. She now continues her
          physiotherapy career in orthopedics, with a focus on identifying the root causes of movement dysfunction and
          retraining the body through optimal movement patterns.
        </p>
        <p>
          Candice believes strongly in evidence-based practice and uses an individualized, patient-centered approach.
          She understands that every person has different needs, goals, and expectations. Her treatment incorporates
          manual therapy, exercise programs, functional dry needling, education, soft tissue work, and joint
          mobilizations.
        </p>
        <p className="clear-left">
          She encourages patients to adopt exercise as a lifestyle to bring about long-lasting, positive functional
          outcomes. When not at work, Candice enjoys spending time with her family and exploring new places.
