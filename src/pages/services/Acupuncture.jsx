        <p className="mb-4">
          Acupuncture is a traditional Chinese medicine technique that involves inserting fine needles into specific points of the body to relieve pain, reduce inflammation, and restore balance. In physiotherapy, it is often used to manage musculoskeletal pain, release muscle tension, and promote natural healing by stimulating the nervous system.

        <p className="mb-6">
          Dry needling is a modern treatment technique used by physiotherapists to target muscle trigger points, reduce pain, and restore movement. It involves inserting thin, sterile needles into tight muscle, scar tissue, or knots. This stimulates blood flow and releases muscle tensionâ€”highly effective for chronic pain, sports injuries, and muscle tightness.
