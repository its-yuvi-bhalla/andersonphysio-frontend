        At <strong>Anderson Physiotherapy Clinic</strong>, our specialized vestibular physiotherapists are highly trained in diagnosing and treating a variety of balance and dizziness-related disorders, including vertigo. We understand how disorienting and disruptive these symptoms can be to your daily life, and weâ€™re here to provide compassionate, results-driven care.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Vertigo is one of the most common vestibular disorders and can feel like the room is spinning, rocking, or tiltingâ€”even while you're completely still. These episodes may come and go, or persist for hours or days, depending on the cause. Vertigo can be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, sweating, blurred vision, and difficulty with coordination or walking.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Often, vertigo is a symptom of an underlying issue with the inner ear or the parts of the brain that control balance and spatial orientation. Conditions such as BPPV (Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo), vestibular neuritis, and labyrinthitis are frequently treated using physiotherapy.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Vestibular rehabilitation is a specialized form of physiotherapy that involves custom-tailored exercises designed to retrain the brain to compensate for inner ear dysfunction. These exercises help improve gaze stability, posture, and balance while reducing symptoms like dizziness, unsteadiness, and motion sensitivity.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        With the right therapy plan, many patients experience a significant reduction in symptoms and regain their confidence in walking, working, and participating in day-to-day activities. Our team at Anderson is committed to guiding you every step of the way toward a safer, steadier life.
