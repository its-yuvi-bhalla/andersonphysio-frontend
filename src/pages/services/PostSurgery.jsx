        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">What Is Post-Surgery Rehabilitation?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Post-surgical rehabilitation, also known as post-operative rehab, is a structured recovery
          plan led by a licensed physiotherapist. Whether you’re recovering from orthopedic surgery like a knee replacement,
          shoulder repair, or spinal procedure, physiotherapy helps reduce pain, rebuild strength, and regain full function.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-8 mb-4">Why Is Post-Operative Physiotherapy Important?</h2>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Following surgery, your body needs time and support to heal properly. Without rehab, patients often face complications such as:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-2 mb-6">
          <li>Joint stiffness and reduced range of motion</li>
          <li>Muscle weakness and poor balance</li>
          <li>Delayed healing and return to daily activities</li>
        </ul>
        <p className="mb-4">
          Our Calgary-based post-surgical rehab programs are designed to prevent these issues and help you return to your best life—
          whether that means walking comfortably, playing sports, or working pain-free.
        </p>
